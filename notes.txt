Use dot notation in search for matching portions of a document.
For example, given the document:

{name:"Sri", email: { work: "sri@work.com", home: "sri@home.com"}}

The following will find the above doc:

c.find({"email.work": "sri@work.com"})

however the following will not

c.find({email: {work: "sri@work.com"}})

All comparison operations in MongoDB are strongly & dynamically typed.

c.find({name: {$gt: "M", $lt: "X"}})

will only search for documents where the name is a String.  IOW if the 
'name' field has non-numeric values in some document they will not 
be tested for this comparison.

Searching for a field by its type.
For example: Find all documents where the name field is a number

c.find({name: {$type: 10}})

here is the type value for a 32-bit integer in the BSON spec
(see http://bsonspec.org/#/specification)

regex searches are not as optimzable as normal string comparison
searches.
